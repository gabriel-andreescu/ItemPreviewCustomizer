# Item Preview Customizer

Customizes item preview zoom and rotation without requiring mesh edits.

---

## User Configuration

Place JSON files directly in:

```
Data\SKSE\Plugins\ItemPreviewCustomizer
```

Each file contains an array of rules. Rules match normalized mesh paths. Matching is case-insensitive, accepts `/` or
`\`, and supports `*` wildcards.

```json
[
  {
    "models": ["meshes\\johnskyrim\\uniques\\rings\\*_go.nif"],
    "zoom": 0.25,
    "rotation": {
      "x": 0.0,
      "y": 0.0,
      "z": 0.0
    }
  }
]
```

- `zoom` is optional and maps to the mesh root `BSInvMarker` zoom value.
- `rotation` is optional and uses degrees. You may set only the axes you want to override.
- A rule may set `zoom`, `rotation`, or both. Rules with neither are ignored.

### Rule Priority

JSON files in `Data\SKSE\Plugins\ItemPreviewCustomizer` load alphabetically. Subfolders are not scanned. Rules
inside each file load from top to bottom.

For the same mesh path, the last exact rule is used. If there is no exact rule for that mesh, the last matching wildcard
rule is used.

Editing existing JSON files: run `ReloadIPC`, then reopen the inventory. Newly created JSON files require a game
restart.

Currently only meshes with a root `BSInvMarker` are supported.

### Console Commands

- `ReloadIPC`: reloads existing config files from disk.
- `CopyIPCPath`: copies a JSON rule for the current inventory preview.
- `CopyIPCPath 1`: includes the current preview rotation.

## Clone and Build

Open terminal (e.g., PowerShell) and run the following commands:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/gabriel-andreescu/ItemPreviewCustomizer.git
cd ItemPreviewCustomizer
cmake --preset default
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Optionally:

```
cp CMakeUserPresets.json.example CMakeUserPresets.json
```

### **Debugging**

- [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless/releases)

- build [SKSE](https://github.com/ianpatt/skse64) from sources with the Debug config
- copy the built files and their PDB to the Skyrim folder
- run `skse64_loader.exe`
- attach debugger to `SkyrimSE.exe`

### **Deployment**

Use the user preset (see `CMakeUserPresets.json.example`) to automatically copy the plugin to your Skyrim Data
directory, if configured.

```
cmake --preset user-default
cmake --build --preset release
```

For deployment to multiple targets split the paths with a `;` (e.g., `C:/path1/data;C:/path2/data`).
